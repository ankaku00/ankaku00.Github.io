## Analyzing Food and Grocery Delivery Throughout the Year
<img src="images/order-food-on-your-hand-1_orig.png?raw=true"/>

As part of my first step towards a career in data analysis, I joined a data analytics accelerator boot camp. The first project introduced in this course was on a data set for a company similar to DoorDash that was modified for this program. This project made me wonder questions, like "What products bring in the most profit?", "Who are their main consumers?", and "Are there any noticeable trends from their campaigns?".Utilizing Excel and the data set given in the course, I was able to answer these questions and learn how the company sales and demographics work. From my analysis, I was able to find:
- 76% of consumers are aged 36-65
- Over $150000 was spent on wine by consumers
- Over 90% of the company's consumers have a college degree
- $1.13 million was spent by consumers


### The Data
This data set was originally a data analyst use case for an interview process.
Here is the data set:

- AcceptedCmp4: Did The Customer Accept Offer in 4th Campaign
- AcceptedCmp5: Did The Customer Accept Offer in 5th Campaign
- AcceptedCmp6: Did The Customer Accept Offer in 6th Campaign
- Age Group

-education_PHD: Is the customer's highest education level a PhD?
-education_2n Cycle: Is the customer’s highest education high school?

### The Analysis
<img src="images/Money Spent by Product.png?raw=true"/>
Using the sum function in Excel, the total money spent through "DoorDash" was $1,139,418. We produced the chart above to further break down the money spent by product. Consumers spent the most money on wine products, coming to a total of $150,068. Consumers also spent $90,571 on meat products. One possible way to use this finding is by trying to gain new consumers and having campaigns or special deals for meat or wine products. Another option is to have special deals for the products consumers spend less on to entice them to buy more fruit, sweet, fish, or gold products.
